# Description
Mr. Merlino Returns is an psychological horror indie game, based on an urban legend about a murderous creature called Mr. Merlino who haunts you if you delete eclipse from ANY computer.

The game is completely in 3D, it is designed for the Windows platform, but I also made a port for the mobile version, and is controllable with comfortable touch buttons on the screen.
